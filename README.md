# HCDE-410-Final

This is the final project for HCDE 410 in UW. I will be an analysis on Seattle crime data.

Data Used: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5

Research questions and hypophysis I will be investigating:

1)
Q: What is the impact of days in a week on the number of Burglaries?
H: Burglary happens more on weekdays than on weekends (explanation: people are more likely to stay home on the weekend which makes burglary hard.).
2)
Q: How has COVID impact on numbers of Burglary?
H: Burglary decrease during COVID (explanation: people are more likely to be at home.).
3)
Q: How has BLM incidence impact on numbers of Burglary?
H: Burglary increases a little bit during BLM incidence (explanation: heard a lot of smashing shops on the news.).
4)
Q: How does the crime rate around UW compare to the rest of the Seattle Area?
H: The area around UW has less crime (I hope).
