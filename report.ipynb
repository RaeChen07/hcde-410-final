    "As a semi-new resident in Seattle, I am curious how crimes looked like in Seattle. Especially during the eventful 2020. I want to investigate do events like COVID and BLM affect crimes. Do crime rates differ given time and area. This project only focused on burglary crimes but can be easily adapted to process other kinds of crimes. In this project, I am using the Seattle goverment database on crimes https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5. This database has a Public Domain License. It contains the time, type of crime, and other data in it from 2008 to now. Government data is reliable and it contain data that my intended goal.  "

    "The above article did research on all crime in the US and analyzed the impact of COVID and a little bit BLM. For burglary, this article finds that residential burglary decreases and non-residential burglary increases. But it does not have any information on the overall COVID impact on burglary (and also not a local analysis). I want to find out if Seattle follows the trend of the US or if it has a surprising outcome.  \n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_crime  \n",
    "The Wikipedia page of Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime stated that some type of crime dropped significantly while other increase. Burglary does not seem to be in the increasing crime category. The Wikipedia page gives five types of main increasing crime including Counterfeiting and fraud, Cybercrime, Domestic violence, Hate crimes, and Terrorist attacks. In the hate crime section it stated \"increase of hate crime incidents against Asian Americans\". This makes me wonder if Seattle has the same problem, but unfortunately the database I plan to use does not have a hate crime category.  "

    "Burglaries seem to happen less on weekends and more on Friday. The number of burglaries seems to be dropping after the stay-at-home order and increasing after the BLM protest. A possible explanation is that it is hard to rob a home when the owner of the house is in the house, but it also makes it easy to rob companies. Further research can be done to see if there is a causation relationship between COVID and burglary crimes.  \n",
    "For the rise of number after BLM protest, one explanation can be that it had been two month after the stay-at-home order, people get board at home, and there were a lot of report on breaking in shops. So people start going out again, which give burglaries more chance."
